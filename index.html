                The data I used to visualize is statistics from tennis matches of the 2016 ATP world tennis tour.
                For this particular visualization, I chose to show the number of aces hit by players at masters and
                grand slam tournaments. In order to show this information, I utilized three visual encodings:
                position, length, and color. I used position to encode the value of aces for each tournament
                because it is main quantitative value for this visualization. I wanted viewers to be able to
                quickly see and comprehend the total number of aces hit. The length encoding is found in the
                height of each bar in the graph. I chose this encoding because it would allow viewers to quickly
                comprehend the differences between the number of aces between tournaments. In order to aid in this
                comparison, the number of aces for each tournament was sorted from smallest to largest. By sorting,
                it tells the reader that the right value is greater than the left value which helps when the heights
                are very close. The color on each bar graph represents the court surface that each tournament was.
                Green was for grass courts, brown was for clay, and blue was for hard surfaces. Using a bar graph
                with this encoding helped as there was more area for each piece of data to be colored, making each
                court surface easy to identify.

                The first control element is the row of colored buttons. This control allows the viewer to filter
                which tournaments are shown based on court surface. I chose this button layout versus a drop down
                menu because I wanted to also use this not only as a control but a color key to the different colors
                in the bar graph. To help show that only one button can be pressed at a time, the buttons are grouped
                together and only the selected button will have bolded text. This control allows the user to ask the
                question of how court surface types affect the number of aces hit by players? The second control
                element is a drop down menu letting the viewer control whether the graph shows values from winners,
                losers, or both. A drop down menu was used as only one option can be picked at a time, and bolded
                text on the side of the drop down menu reflects what filter has been chosen. Using this control,
                the user is able to ask the question: do winners or losers hit more aces in matches? The final control
                is a list of the different round of the tournament. The user is able to toggle each element of this
                list on or off. The control is initially set without some of the options selected because some of
                the tournaments contain more rounds than the others, making an unfair comparison. This control
                allows the user to ask the question of how many aces were hit in finals, RO32, or quarterfinals
                and semifinals? With all these different control elements, the user can begin to ask more complex
                questions. For example, in the finals of hard court tennis tournaments, which tournament had the
                most number of aces hit by losers? Another example is, in the RO32 and semifinals of clay courts,
                which tournament had the most number of aces hit by both winners and losers?
